# 🛍️ Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

This project applies unsupervised learning (K-Means clustering) to segment customers of a mall based on their **Annual Income** and **Spending Score**. 

## 📊 Objective
Group similar customers together to help businesses:
- Target the right audience 🎯
- Improve marketing strategies 💸
- Understand customer behavior 🔍

## 📁 Dataset
- `Mall_Customers.csv`  
Contains 200 entries with customer demographics and spending behavior.

## 🧠 Features Used
- `Annual Income (k$)`
- `Spending Score (1-100)`

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries
- Python 3
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- Google Colab

## 📈 Output
- Elbow Method plot to choose best number of clusters (k)
- Clustered scatter plot showing customer segments
- Cluster labels added to dataset

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Upload the dataset in Google Colab
2. Run the notebook
3. View visualizations
4. Download `clustered_customers.csv` if needed
